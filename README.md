# Unity from Scratch: Shooting Gallery
A small game implemented using Unity Visual Scripting Language

[Unity From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBBRLwJVhEhOBMNBVX6kIEzPMkhILFy7k) is a YouTube video series about how one can move from creating games in Scratch into game development using Unity Visual Scripting language.

I developed this game as an example to develop in both platforms and explain the whole transition one needs to make when switching from one to the other.

Try the game in [itch.io](https://tomazsaraiva.itch.io/unity-from-scratch).
